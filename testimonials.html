        <h3> <i> We had our wedding at Lough Rynn Castle and I was beyond impressed with the professionalism of the staff. In particular I would like to thank Gina Wild who was our wedding co-ordinator and was incredibly helpful with my numerous requests. Lough Rynn is like a home away from home. The feedback that I got from my guests was exceptional in terms of food and service. I could not rate Lough Rynn highly enough and I cannot wait to make a return visit. <br>
